I am a technology leader, architect, mentor, code wrangler, and software poet in the Scala "Big Data" or "Fast Data" space. I am currently architecting real-time stream processing and analytics tools for real-time event processing.

I consider myself a "Complete Stack" Engineer, from Leadership to Management, Developer to Architect, Build Engineer to DevOps, Project Manager to System Administrator. My days are usually interesting.

I value the quality of the solutions I craft for their building, testing, and maintenance characteristics. When writing new code or re-factoring existing code, I insist on testing from everyone, to ensure correct functionality and consistency with the most up-to-date programming practices and paradigms.

I am always on the lookout for new technologies and solutions that truly simplify the development and maintenance of applications, and not just talk hype. Every decrease in development time will lead to increased ROI for customers and my company.

As a developer, I always strive to leave any code I create or modify at least a little bit better than when I began working on it.

As a leader, I want to always make my environment more productive and profitable.
